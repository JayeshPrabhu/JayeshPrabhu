# üí´ About Me:
I was born and raised with a passion for learning and technology. My academic journey started at Holy Rosary Convent School, where I completed my S.S.L.C with a solid foundation, scoring 79.28%. I then moved on to Siddhartha P.U College, where I sharpened my skills and achieved an impressive 89.66% in my P.U.C.<br><br>Currently, I'm pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Science and Engineering at Canara Engineering College, under Visvesvaraya Technological University. My hard work and dedication have helped me maintain a CGPA of 8.88, and I expect to graduate in 2025.<br><br>Beyond academics, I‚Äôve always been inclined towards leadership roles. Serving as a class representative since 2021 has allowed me to develop my leadership and communication skills. I also took up the role of event coordinator for **CodeQuest** during Aakriti, a state-level techno-cultural fest at my college, where I gained valuable experience in event management and teamwork.<br><br>I believe in constant learning, which is why I‚Äôve earned certifications in programming and web development. These experiences have strengthened my ability to adapt, solve problems, and work effectively in a team. As I continue this journey, I am eager to explore new opportunities and collaborate with others to create something meaningful and impactful.
